                <p class=" ans">
                    JVM (Java Virtual Machine): JVM(Java Virtual Machine) acts as 
                    a run-time engine to run Java applications. JVM is the one that 
                    calls the main method present in Java code. JVM is a part of 
                    JRE(Java Runtime Environment).
                    JRE (Java Runtime Environment): JRE refers to a runtime environment
                     in which Java bytecode can be executed. It implements the JVM
                      (Java Virtual Machine) and provides all the class libraries and 
                      other support files that JVM uses at runtime. So JRE is a 
                      software package that contains what is required to run a Java 
                      program. It’s an implementation of the JVM which physically exists. 
                    JDK(Java Development Kit): It is the tool necessary to compile, 
                    document, and package Java programs. The JDK completely includes
                     JRE which contains tools for Java programmers. The Java Development
                      Kit is provided free of charge. Along with JRE, it includes an
                       interpreter/loader, a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), 
                       a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed 
                       in Java development. In short, it contains JRE + development
                        tools.

                <h3  class="ques-tag">Q2. Explain public static void main(String args[]). </h3>
                <p class=" ans">
                    Public: Public is an access modifier. Public means that this Method will be accessible by any Class.<br> 
                    static: It is a keyword in java that identifies it as class-based i.e it can be accessed without creating the instance of a Class. Since we want the main method to be executed without any instance also, we use static. <br> 
                    Void: It is the return type of the method. Void defines the method which will not return any value. <br> 
                    main: This is the first method executed by JVM. The signature of the method must be the same.<br>

                <h3  class="ques-tag">Q3. Why Java is platform independent?</h3>
                <p class=" ans">
                    Platform independence practically means “write once run anywhere”. Java is called so because of its byte codes which can run on any system irrespective of its underlying operating system.

                <h3  class="ques-tag">Q4. Why is Java not purely Object-oriented? </h3>
                <p class=" ans">
                    Java is not considered pure Object-oriented because it supports primitive data types such as boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, and short.

                <h3  class="ques-tag">Q5. Define class and object. Explain them with an example using java.</h3>
                <p class=" ans">
                    Class: A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. In general, class declarations can include these components, in order:<br> 
                    Superclass(if any): The name of the class’s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.<br> 
                    Interfaces: A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.<br> 
                    Object: It is a basic unit of Object Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities.  A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of :<br> 
                    State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.<br> 
                    Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.<br> 
                    Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects. <br>
