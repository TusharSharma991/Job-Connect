                        Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
                        language that is designed to have as few implementation 
                        dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming
                        language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere
                        (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all 
                        platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.

                        Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
                         Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the 
                         use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.
                        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports 
                        multiple programming paradigms, including structured 
                        (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional 
                        programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" 
                        language due to its comprehensive standard library.

                        Data structure and algorithms is a branch of computer science 
                        that deals with creating machine-efficient and optimized 
                        computer programs. The term Data Structure refers to the 
                        storage and organization of data, and Algorithm refers to the 
                        step by step procedure to solve a problem. By combining "data 
                        structure" and "algorithm", we optimize the codes in software 
                        engineering.

                        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language 
                        that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside
                         HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the 
                         client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party 
                         libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine
                          to execute the code on users' devices.
